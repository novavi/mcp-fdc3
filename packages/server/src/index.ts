  //   When targeting a single running instance of a given app, this would avoid the need to first invoke fdc3.findInstances
  //   in order to raise the intent on the first instance.
  //   MCP-FDC3 library could potentially offer 'firstOrDefault' as an additional option e.g. with the client library processing
  //   the option (only when set) by invoking fdc3.findInstances and then fdc3.raiseIntent. When the option was not set, MCP-FDC3
  //   client library could simply just invoke fdc3.raiseIntent.
  //   But a better solution might be to extend the FDC3 API to natively support this functionality. This would avoid the need for
  //   'special' options in the MCP-FDC3 library, and moreover would make the functionality available to regular client-side app
  //   code that consumes the FDC3 API.
  //2. Launching of new instances of target apps - see the comment in the 'createFdc3OpenResource' method below for thoughts on this.
